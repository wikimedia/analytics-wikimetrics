"""
We use a tree-based report model to represent the relationships
between tasks which have a partial ordering, but which should
still be loosely coupled or asynchronous.  For example, if we want
to compute the average of some metric for a cohort, it makes sense
to first compute the metric for each user and then take the average.
In this example both steps would Reports, and the averaging task would
register the task of computing the actual metric as its child.

Specifically, we distinguish between `ReportLeaf` instances, which have no
subreports, and `ReportNode` isntances, which require their children to be
excecuted first, before carrying out their task.  Computing a simple
metric would be a `ReportLeaf`, whereas any aggregator would be a `ReportNode`
